# Malware-Detection-Using-Neural-Network
A Neural Network-Based Approach for Detecting Malware from EMBER Dataset

## EMBER Dataset (https://github.com/elastic/ember)
The EMBER dataset (Endgame Malware BEnchmark for Research) is a labelled dataset for training machine learning models to detect malware. It includes features extracted from Windows executable files and provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating malware detection algorithms. The dataset contains a mix of benign and malicious executables and is used widely in cybersecurity research for developing and testing new malware detection techniques.

The notebook appears to cover the following steps in developing a malware classifier using the EMBER dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):

### Importing Libraries:
Fundamental libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib.pyplot.
Specific libraries: ember for the EMBER dataset, and altair for visualization (though not used explicitly).

### Reading Data:
Utilizes a memory-mapped array interface in NumPy for accessing large arrays stored in binary files.

### Data Manipulation:
Converts data into pandas DataFrames.
Reduces data size by keeping only a subset of rows.
Combines features and labels into a single DataFrame.
Removes rows with unlabeled data and drops the label column from the features DataFrame.
Converts DataFrames back to numpy arrays for further processing.

### Dimension Reduction and Normalization:
Reduces dimensions by removing the last 77 columns from the feature array.
Normalizes data using Min-Max scaling to the range [0, 255].

### Reshaping Data and Visualization:
Prepares data to be represented as images by reshaping it into a 3D array.
Rescales pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Visualizes a subset of images with their corresponding labels.

### Building the Model:
Initializes a Sequential model.
Adds convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, flatten layers, and dense layers.
Compiles the model with specific loss function and optimizer.

### Evaluating the Model:
Evaluate the model on the test data and print loss and accuracy.
Makes predictions with the model.
Generates a classification report and confusion matrix.
Plots the ROC curve and calculates the AUC score.
